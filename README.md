TweetCache
==========

Fetch and Cache Tweets to use easily with blogger.js (Update for API 1.1)
- relies on <a href="https://github.com/themattharris/tmhOAuth">tmhOAuth</a> by themattharris

All calls to Twitter to fetch Tweets must now be authenticated (using API 1.1).
A lot of sites/bloggers have been using blogger.js with a get_status URL to fetch tweets which will not work anymore.

To save time, use TweetCache. It caches your tweets in a simple text file, and can be easily used as a replacement for the get_status URL without the need to change anything else on your site/blog.
